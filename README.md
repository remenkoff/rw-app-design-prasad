Key points:

- Create Figma account to be able to create workspace;
- Drag .fig file into Figma app interface to import design;
- Use *Design* panel, shapes (oval and lines), alignment and grouping to create a simple close button;
- Use *Prototype* panel to add an interaction to navigate back and forth between frames (screens);

- Built-in frames allows you to create frames of predefined sizes (e.g. iPhone SE, iPad mini, etc.);
- Use shape tools and its properties to create and style basic shapes;
- Use Option+WASD hotkeys to align selected shape to top, left, bottom and right respectively;
- Use Auto Layout to create adaptive UI elements;
